[Verse 1]
I won't spend my life, waiting for an angel to descend
Searching for a rainbow with an end

[Refrain]
Now that I've found you
I'll call off the search

[Verse 2]
And I won't spend my life gazing at the stars up in the sky
Wondering if love will pass me by

[Refrain]
Now that I've found you
I'll call off the search

[Bridge]
Out on my own I would never have known
This world that I see today
And I've got a feeling
It won't fade away

And I won't end my days wishing that love would come along
'Cause you are in my life where you belong`,

[Verse 1]
Every morning about half past eight
My mama wakes me, says "Don't be late"
Get to the office, trying to concentrate

My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill

So I stop one day to figure it out
I'll quit my job without a shadow of a doubt
To sing the blues that I know about

[Refrain]
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill

[Bridge]
Minute after minute
Second after second
Hour after hour goes by
Working for a rich girl
Staying just a poor girl
Never stop to wonder why

So here I am in London town
A better scene I'm gonna be around
The kind of music that won't bring me down`,

[Verse 1]
How can I think I'm standing strong
Yet feel the air beneath my feet?
How can happiness feel so wrong?
How can misery feel so sweet?
How can you let me watch you sleep
Then break my dreams the way you do?
How can I have got in so deep?
Why did I fall in love with you?

[Chorus]
This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known
I was never crazy on my own
And now I know that there's a link between the two
Being close to craziness and being close to you

[Verse 2]
How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies?
It's so easy to break a heart
It's so easy to close your eyes
How can you treat me like a child
Yet like a child I yearn for you?
How can anyone feel so wild?
How can anyone feel so blue?`,

That oysters make you come on strong

Won't take no pills
That's the last thing that I need to do
I can't deny it
My aphrodisiac is you

[Chorus]
Alright, I could sniff some powdered rhino horn
And go to bed in rubber gloves
But I don't need no stimulation
Potions, balms or embrocation
I'm in love

[Verse 2]
In other words
Don't smoke no grass
Or opium from old Hong Kong
That hubble-bubble
Just makes me see you double
All night long
Don't waste my time
With Spanish fly and roots to chew
They cause me trouble
Because my aphrodisiac is you

[Verse 1]
I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Lost my heart in its recipe
It made me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

But I think more than I ought to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

[Chorus 1]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Oh lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me, nearly here?

[Chorus 2]
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I going crazy, dear?

You're beautiful so silently
It lies beneath a shade of blue
It struck me so violently
When I looked at you

But others pass; they never pause
To feel that magic in your hand
To me, you're like a wild rose
They never understand why

I cried for you, and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

For a different world
With your treasure, a secret
For me to hold

In many years they may forget
This love of ours or that we met

        They say we never landed on the moon
There's no wind there, they assume
I guess conspiracies are nothing new
But I'm sure I've been there with you
And I don't believe that in space
The only life is here on earth
How could we be the only race
That loves and hates 'til death from birth?
But I do believe in love
Though I should never rely on love
Nothing else excites me
But loving you
Is it true a politician's heart
Can rust away and fall apart?
I guess it must be hard
It must be hard to know what's good
And to know what's easy
You might think it's strange
For all my wild ideas
But I do not believe that change
Can ever happen without tears
But I do believe in love
Though I should never rely on love
Nothing else excites me
But loving you

Worth a king's ransom

Charlie Chaplin, he was invited

David Griffith worked as an extra
Then as a stagehand
Until they let him be
A director

Dave was brave, a mover and shaker
A true pioneer

A real film maker

        Missing the train every morning at 8:52
Sipping coffee from the same cup as you
The sharing of secrets we thought no one else knew
That's what I miss about you

The new way that love had made me see
Your bashful grin when you asked if I would like your key
The knowing way you used to caress me
That's what I miss about you

You stole in with your starry smile exciting me
Driving with you in your new car, feeling free
If it's true that love is blind, then I was blind willingly
You made me feel we had a future, that could be and would be

The way you said I'd be no one on my own
Your habit of soaking yourself in over-priced cologne
The way you turned the light out when I knew you were home
That's what I don't miss about you

I bet you're using your weary magic like it's new
Driving so fast with a new fool beside you
Presumably believing she's the last of the lucky few
I wonder if she knows she's being lied to like I do

The way I only doubted myself when I was with you
Like I was a fool for expecting something from life too
Your skill of putting me down in-front of everyone we knew

But I wish I'd never found
In the privacy of your own room

[Chorus]
Where flowers in the wallpaper bloom
Where I just don't understand
In the privacy of your room

Look away now, look away now
At the moon

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Is somebody watching me?
You really shouldn't see
Why did you climb that last stair?
You found me unaware

        I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
Maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling

But if we only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start

Every now and then life says:
Where do you think you're going so fast?
We're apt to think it's cruel, but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind

And if we get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills and horizon

There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say:
A word or two, my friend

I used to dream myself to somewhere else each night
I dreamed in colour

Until I chanced upon this road that led to you
I couldn't see
How anything could be

Chorus:
.. Better than a dream
Stranger than my wild imagination
If this is a real sensation
It's better than a dream
Higher than the moon
Hazy like a beautiful illusion
Crazy and in confusion
And better than a dream
I used to wish I was beyond some distant door
I knew there must be more to life
And now I'm sure
No dreams of pirate caves
Or indian braves, or magic carpets could
Ever be this good

Shining through the twilight

        It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

Going to the store and make a choice
But everything she sees, it's like they're talking
Talking at her with a different voice

[Verse 1]
Laura's head is buzzing, can't remember what she came here for
Couldn't keep her promise not to gaze at things she can't afford
'Cause there's shoes, bags and silk scarves and dreams of summer days
And now she's wording a letter to her bosses for a raise

[Pre-Chorus]
But then she passes the baby section
With the tiniest shoes on shiny trays

[Chorus]
It's a time to buy, a time for shopping
Going to the store and make a choice
But everything she sees, it's like they're talking
Talking at her with their different voices
A singer's voice and her mother's pleas
And the voice of countless charities
But the one she heeds with certainty says
"Have it all

The seats were all dusty, the side doors were open
Those aeroplanes were left there years ago
Granddad had spoken of forests in Russia
I pictured him walking in ten inches of snow

[Chorus]
We liked pretending those planes could fly
That nothing was out of reach in the whole of the sky
It was just pretending, simple to do
We'd make some plans and travel someplace new

[Verse 2]
Paris and London, those cities in movies
Perfect lives were lived if they could be believed
Back in the real world they seemed so distant
But none of it mattered in the aeroplane field

[Chorus]
We liked pretending those planes could fly
That rusty old wings knew the entire sky
It was just pretending, there was nothing more
Hey, why the sad face? Can't you feel this cabin soar?

Till he appeared and the world felt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by a light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the men from the orient land

The king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine

He said he loved me in his quiet manner
I was watching the crocuses in awe

A summer with a gentle sea breeze
We never stopped or talked too long
He'd say you're the only one I'm after
Are you just gonna keep walking on

He loves me

His wife's hair had golden ripples
She's in a painting with a mulberry tree
When I asked him did hе love me better
He didn't even look at me

Then they had a party in their garden
Their dresses billowed with fear and lust
She handed me a cloudy glass and then said

You'll see some good if you extend the trust

I watched as the whiteness melted away

And he mentioned a forest buried in ice

He wanted to go and show it off glistening
And it all came alive in our listening
I could hear crisp Edelweiss
Just in the words that rang in my mind
It really did glow like art in a gallery
In the mind, and then it was vanishing
And that place that was there
Deep in thе land
It put something new in the air

[Verse 2]
Down in the valley, homes letting out smoke
And signs of landslides, I saw as he spoke
Dad said "let's go there, it's right on our way"
But we didn't have time to, we'll see it someday

He said, "Everyone is getting married"
I said, "Well, don't let that force the matter"
I know the way these days can go
We're gonna get carried away

[Refrain]
Oh, 'cause when the sea is strong
And when the vibe is good
And the music plays
And you're looking over in all your sea surging ways
He's getting carried away
Somewhere up high

[Verse 2]
I like the way that he surfs
And he wants to go on a silent retreat
I told him I was getting into ballet
Now I'm getting carried away, ooh

[Refrain]
Look, it's in every day living
If you wanna make it in romance
Something will need to start giving
Or how are you gonna make it fit between
The tempos and the songs and all that overthinking?

I had a day, wasn't inspired
Leaves were swaying, saying, "Go outside"
Every word I wrote, I felt like a liar
Every line oversimplified

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you pick me up with a little joke
Then you pick me up by diving into sweet talk
Walking in the shining rain

[Chorus]
Gratitude comes with you everywhere you go
Gratitude comes with you

[Verse 2]
When there's a day that's sad and nostalgic
Tryna write for the city crowd
Still believing that a record is magic
But apathy still pulls me down

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you pick me up with a park game
Then you pick me up by pointing to a blue sky
We turn our phones off for the day

        [Verse 1]
Sometimes I need to sit quietly, all on my own
Speak with nobody and do nothing
Be like a cherry tree in the wind
Shedding its blossom on everything

[Chorus]
All I need is to feel the sun in the morning (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Watch the world go by 'til the evening (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
That won't get any respect, status or money in this world
But, oh, it's those sweet days I live for
Oh, it's those sweet days I wish for

[Verse 2]
A message from you with a last-minute invite
But I see a free day ahead
Maybe a walk in the city park
Only a weightlessness in my heart

[Chorus]
All I need is to feel the sun in the morning (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Watch the world go by 'til the evening (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
That won't get any rеspect, status or money in this world
But, oh, it's those sweet days I wish for
Oh, it's thosе sweet days I live for

You didn't have to ask me if I was free today
I came and sat beside you and then, we drove away
I was in the neighbourhood, pretending to be someone good
Bringing love and money home
You didn't have to worry, this thing's been going 'round
Don't tell me about the jewellery or where it can be found
Dad said it's a false alarm, I thought he sounded strangely calm
That didn't stop me running home

[Chorus]
Holding the line between the shows and interviews
Never had timе to give the best of mе to you
You set me free, free to go it alone with nothing to owe you
But a voice down the phone
Sending love and money home

[Verse 2]
In the town of Kutaisi, they named me after you
Acting was your fantasy that never did come true
But Heaven's voice cast its spell and showed me how to give them hell
Handed down with love from you

[Chorus]
Holding the line between the shows and interviews
Never had time to give the best of me to you
You set me free, free to go it alone with nothing to owe you
But a voice down the phone
Sending love and money home
Sending love and money home
